BuildingNeighborColoring:
is a Python code for QGIS to analyze and visualize the connectivity of buildings in a spatial dataset. The script identifies neighboring buildings for each feature and applies color-coding to highlight their adjacency relationships. 
Buildings with one neighbor will be marked with blue color, more than one neighbor will be marked in red, while those with exactly one neighbor are marked in yellow. 
This tool is particularly useful for urban planning, spatial analysis, and visualizing building connectivity. It integrates seamlessly into QGIS, allowing users to enhance their GIS workflows and better understand spatial relationships within their datasets.
